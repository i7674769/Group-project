# Group-project
A place we can start to input our ideas.

Guys, let's use this file to collect the things that need fixing. Then we can keep track of them and if any of us have time, they can try to take care of them. So far:

- we have to change the settings for the myphpdatabase (I will send you the log-in details in a sek) because so far our collum does not allow " ' " and we have to find a solution for that
- we need an option to delete accounts once they are set up 
- there has to be a way to check if people use the same student ID (for signing up) twice and a error message for that
