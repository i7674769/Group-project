# Group-project
A place we can start to input our ideas.

Guys, let's use this file to collect the things that need fixing. Then we can keep track of them and if any of us have time, they can try to take care of them. So far:

-> I created Issue files for that so we can all have an overview of what still has to be done and mark it as "done" once we fixed it :) If you find another issue just add it :)
